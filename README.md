### Microprocessors

On completion of the course, the student understands the structure and operating principles of a conventional (CISC) microprocessor. The student knows how the CISC and RISC architectures differ and understands the importance of registers, instruction set and addressing modes.

The student will be capable of writing simple assembler programs and will be well-prepared to learn low level programming (e.g. device drivers) in assembler and C languages.
